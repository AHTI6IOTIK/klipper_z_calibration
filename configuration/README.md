# Sample Configuration

This are some parts of my V2 300 configurations describing all the mag-probe, probing
and QGL stuff.

Some parts are from [zellneralex](https://github.com/zellneralex/klipper_config/tree/master)
and from the [Annex Script](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_Other_Printer_Mods/blob/master/All_Printers/Microswitch_Probe/Klipper_Macros/dockable_probe_macros.cfg)

**CAUTION: Please, don't just copy it - understand and adapt for your needs instead!
Use this on your own risk!**
